# How-To-Practice

1. Create a topic list(every possible category, from easy to advanced)
2. Select a topic
3. Learn the topic
4. Solve lots of problems about that topic
5. Go to 2

And of course, participate in every possible contests in every online judge.

That was my strategy. You can make your own that suits you well.

Best Wishes!
