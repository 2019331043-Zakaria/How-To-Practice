- ### How Should I Practice?

  1. Create a topic list(every possible category, from easy to advanced).
  2. Select a topic.
  3. Learn the topic.
  4. Solve lots of problems about that topic.
  5. Go to ii.

  And of course, participate in every possible contests in every online judge.

  That was my strategy. You can make your own that suits you well.

  Best Wishes!
